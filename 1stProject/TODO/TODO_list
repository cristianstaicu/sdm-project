TODO LIST:

- Mediator Entity
- Setup phase for CP-ABE
- Key Generation for CP-ABE (including mediator)
- Key Distribution
- Mediator storage for keys?
- Definition of Access Control Policies - for attributes
- DB encrypted statements
- DEMO

Not necessary but to add more sense to the picture: --> Logs for Mediator in order
to preserve accountability and non repudiation.

mCP-ABE

SETUP PHASE:
1.
- Generate generator g
- generate a bilinear group G0 of prime order p with generator g
- generate bilinear map e:G0xG0 --> G1

2.
- Generate attribute set A={a1,a2,...,an} for some n
- Generate random elements q,t1,t2,...,tn (they belongs to Zp)

ps= q is "alpha" in the slides --> don't have alpha here :D
3.
- Let y=e(g,g)^q
- Tj = g^tj, where (1 <= j <= n)
- Public key = (e, g, y, Tj, (1 <= j <= n))
- Master secret key = (q, tj (1 <= j <= n))
