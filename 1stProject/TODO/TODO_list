TODO LIST:

- Mediator Entity
- Setup phase for CP-ABE
- Key Generation for CP-ABE (including mediator)
- Key Distribution
- Mediator storage for keys?
- Definition of Access Control Policies - for attributes
- DB encrypted statements
- DEMO

Not necessary but to add more sense to the picture: --> Logs for Mediator in order
to preserve accountability and non repudiation.
